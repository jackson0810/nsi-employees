                        <p>
                            In 2008, Naval Systems Incorporated (NSI) opened our Ridgecrest, CA office to support the
                            Unmanned Systems Activity and Counter Improvised Explosive Device (CIED) work at NAWCWD,
                            China Lake. Our staff is embedded in the UAS (now Unmanned Systems Activity) and the
                            Counter IED (CIED) facilities with over 10 years experience in contracting range safety
                            and operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today our office also supports a wide-range of engineering, information assurance,
                            security, and office administration services. NSI at China Lake is committed to the war
                            fighter; developing support teams that cater to weapons development and the technologies
                            of today and far into the future.
                        </p>
